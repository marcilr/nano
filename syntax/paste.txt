"Pasting clipboard contents into Nano requires a regular
right click (or shift+insert). You can mark blocks of text
in Nano only with the keyboard using Alt + A followed by
the arrow keys.  These can be copied to the buffer with
Ctrl + K. You can select text with the mouse to copy it
to the Clipboard (a PuTTY function).Oct 25, 2017"

NOTE: Found the right-click works to paste in Windows 10.
